								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p>Hi I am Abrar Fahim, a final semeter grad student persuing Masters in Electrical Engineering at 
								New York University, Tandon School of Engineering.
								<p>From a very early age I was fascinated by how things work especially toys and robots. 
								For me the real fun would always start after the toys were broken and myself disecting the electro mechanical parts like motors and actuators. 
								From those scraps I wolud make some new kind of toys. This sort of small acomplishment some what made me feel like a mad scientist developing his mad creations. </p>
								<p>I think that early age passion for developing things from scraps ignited my dream to become an Electrical and Electronic Engineer. So after my high school studies 
								I got myself admitted to North South University, a reputed university in Bangladesh. Where I got in touch with real engineering stuff.
								My tenure at North South University as an undergraduate student exposed me to the fascinating courses and well-equipped lab facilities. 
								During my undergrad I also a hidden passion of mine which is teaching. Therefore, in my undergrad years I worked as Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at my own department.
								And after my graduation I joined the same department as part part-time Lab Officer. 
								Where I tought and demonstrated lab experiments for analog electronics, control Systems and c programming language. During my tenure as Lab Officer the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
								As a result the whole academia had to change the paradigm of teaching. At that time I had to formulate new and innovative teaching methods in order me to catch my students attention and make the online class as lively as possible.
								</p>
								<p>As human thirst for knowledge is never ending and it should be quenched as early as possible, I had to leave my job as a Lab officer and join NYU Tandon School of Engineering.
									I started my grad journey on Fall 2021. From the beginning till this day the faculties and student community never failed to amaze me. Studying here at NYU gave me a perspetive in cutting edge research and generated a love for networking & hardware engineering.
									Therefore, with the help of my school I was able to equip my self with the knowledge of Internet Architecture and Protocol, Wireless Network Security, Real Time Embedded Systems, Computer Architecture, Analog Integrated Circuits and VLSI System Design.
									But I believe any engineering knowledge remains half unless it receives industry experience. Therefore, my aim is to join the industry and solidify the knowledge that I have gained.
